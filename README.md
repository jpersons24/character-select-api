# Ultimate Fantasy


This is the Rails API for Ultimate Fantasy!

Begin by cloning or forking the repository: https://github.com/jpersons24/character-select-api

Once you have opened the repository on your machine, begin by running 'bundle install'. This will ensure that you have all necessary Ruby gems installed.

Once you have successfully bundled, simply run 'rails s' or 'rails server' in your terminal to start the server.

To access the sqlite database on your browser, go to localhost:3000 in your browser. This will allow two things:
- You will be able to see JSON formatted database information.
- You can now use the app from the window you have opened through the index.html file. This file can be found in the front end repository: https://github.com/jpersons24/character-select


Enjoy your Ultimate Fantasy Experience!!!
